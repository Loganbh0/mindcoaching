    <h3>What has Rory said about his win?</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Rory McIlroy, on Winning the Masters: “My dreams have been made today.”</li>
            <li>McIlroy, on His Emotions When the Final Putt Dropped: “It was all relief. There wasn't much joy in that reaction. It was all relief.”</li>
            <li>McIlroy, on Never Giving Up Despite So Many Close Calls: “I'm not going to compare it to life moments like a marriage or having a child. But it's the best day of my golfing life. I’m very proud of myself. I'm proud of never giving up. I'm proud of how I kept coming back and dusting myself off and not letting the disappointments really get to me.”</li>
            <li>McIlroy, on Hearing Past Champions Say He Was Going to Win the Masters: “It was a heavy weight to carry and, thankfully, now I don't have to carry it.”</li>
            <li>McIlroy, on What Happens Now That He Won the Masters: “What are we all going to talk about next year?”</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>What have others said?</h3>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>Justin Rose, on Nearly Pulling Off an Epic Comeback: “So it's the kind of putt you dream about as a kid. To have it and hole it, it was a special feeling. And unfortunately, the playoff, they always end so quickly. That’s sudden death. You don't really get an opportunity. If you're not the guy to hit the great shot or hole the great putt, it's over.”</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Rose made 10 birdies, including one on the 18th hole to finish off a final-round 66. He lost to McIlroy on the first hole of the playoff.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Bryson DeChambeau, on the Atmosphere on Sunday: “Electric. I loved it.”</li>
            <ul>
                <li>DeChambeau was in the final pairing with McIlroy on Sunday. He started the day two shots behind, but struggled with 3-over 75 in the final round.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Scottie Scheffler, on Getting in Contention: “I was just proud of the way we hung in there and put up a good fight. A few different things happen today and I maybe have a chance in the tournament. I wasn't far off.”</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The defending champion started the day seven shots behind McIlroy, but he got close down the stretch with a 3-under 69.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Patrick Reed, on Holing Out for Eagle on No. 17: “To make that was really cool because you sit there and go, hey, mathematically I might have a chance.”</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The 2018 champion shot 3-under 69 and finished in third place.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Min Woo Lee, on His Last Hole of This Masters: “It was actually a funny story. I didn't chip in all week, and on 17 I hit it in the front bunker and I said to my caddie, ‘I'm either going to chip this in or I'm going to miss the last green on purpose and chip in.’”</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Lee admitted he didn’t miss the 18th green on purpose, but he did end up in the right bunker – and knocked it in.</li>
